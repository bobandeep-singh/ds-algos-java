## Space used
### In place sorting
Sorting algorithms which does not require any extra space for sorting.<br>
Example: Bubble sort

### Out place sorting
Sorting algorithms which require any extra space for sorting.<br>
Example: Merge sort


## Stable
### Stable
If a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents does not change the sequence of similar content in which they appear, then the sorting is called stable sorting.
